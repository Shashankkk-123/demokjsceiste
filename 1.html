                <h1>Welcome To Our Most Awaited Council Reveal!</h1>
                <p>Every year each council works day and night to conduct events
                    throughout the tenure of the academic year, this is all
                    responsible because of the members of the council and our
                    respected Faculty advisors. The new Academic year has
                    started and we are again back with our council for ISTE and
                    hope they accomplish things as the previous council did, and
                    maintain the name of the council ISTE at KJSCE</p>
